# 1.0 Welcome to Python Essentials 1

## 1.0.1 Learn Python – the language of today and tomorrow
This course is the first in a two-course Python Essentials series. It covers everything you need to know to start designing, writing, running, debugging, and improving Python programs at the foundational level. It also fully prepares you for the PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification exam from the Python Institute.

## 1.0.2 About the course
Welcome to Python Essentials 1! This course has been designed and developed by the OpenEDG Python Institute in partnership with the Cisco Networking Academy.

The course has been created for anyone and everyone who wants to learn Python and modern programming techniques. It will particularly appeal to:

- aspiring programmers and learners interested in learning programming for fun and for job-related tasks;
- learners looking to gain fundamental skills and knowledge for an entry-level job role as a software developer, data analyst, or tester;
- industry professionals wishing to explore technologies that are connected with Python, or that utilize it as a foundation;
- team leaders, product managers, and project managers who want to understand the terminology and processes in the software development cycle to more effectively manage and communicate with production and development teams.

During the course you will have access to hands-on practice materials, labs, quizzes, assessments, and tests to learn how to utilize the skills and knowledge gained from studying the resources and performing coding tasks, and interact with some real-life programming challenges and situations.

## 1.0.3 Syllabus
In this course you will learn:

- the universal concepts of computer programming;
- the syntax and semantics of the Python language;
- practical skills in resolving typical implementation challenges;
- how to use the most important elements of the Python Standard Library;
- how to install your runtime environment;
- how to design, develop, test, and debug simple Python programs.

The course is divided into four modules:

**Module 1**  
Introduction to Python and computer programming;

**Module 2**  
Data types, variables, basic input-output operations, and basic operators;

**Module 3**  
Boolean values, conditional execution, loops, lists and list processing, logical and bitwise operations;

**Module 4**  
Functions, tuples, dictionaries, exceptions, and data processing.

## 1.0.4 Prepare for the PCEP-30-0x exam
Dive into programming, learn Python from scratch, and prepare for the PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification.

Python Essentials 1 is aligned with the PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification, a professional credential that demonstrates the holder’s understanding of the Python language syntax and semantics, as well as their proficiency in using the most essential elements of the language, tools, and resources to design, develop, and refactor simple Python programs.

The certification holder knows the syntax of the Python language to a degree that allows them to work with variables, operators, control flow mechanisms, and functions, as well as understands the fundamentals of the Python data type system, exception handling, troubleshooting, debugging, and the runtime environment.

PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification is an interim step to the PCAP – Certified Associate in Python Programming certification, and the starting point to launch a career in software development, Python programming, and related technologies.

Becoming PCEP certified will help you stand out from other candidates and get your foot in the door.
