# 1.1 Section 1 â€“ Introduction to Programming

## Scroll to begin 

Hello there, and welcome to section one! We will start off by learning about some of the universal concepts of programming, such as instruction list, source file, language elements, compilation and interpretation. Ready? Let's start!

### 1.1.1 How does a computer program work?

A program makes a computer usable. Without a program, a computer, even the most powerful one, is nothing more than an object. Similarly, without a player, a piano is nothing more than a wooden box.

Computers are able to perform very complex tasks, but this ability is not innate. A computer's nature is quite different.

It can execute only extremely simple operations. For example, a computer cannot understand the value of a complicated mathematical function by itself, although this isn't beyond the realms of possibility in the near future.

Contemporary computers can only evaluate the results of very fundamental operations, like adding or dividing, but they can do it very fast, and can repeat these actions virtually any number of times.

Imagine that you want to know the average speed you've reached during a long journey. You know the distance, you know the time, you need the speed.

Naturally, the computer will be able to compute this, but the computer is not aware of such things as distance, speed, or time. Therefore, it is necessary to instruct the computer to:

1. accept a number representing the distance;
2. accept a number representing the travel time;
3. divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;
4. display the result (representing the average speed) in a readable format.

These four simple actions form a program. Of course, these examples are not formalized, and they are very far from what the computer can understand, but they are good enough to be translated into a language the computer can accept.

Language is the keyword.

### 1.1.2 Natural languages vs. programming languages

A language is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts. There are many languages all around us. Some of them require neither speaking nor writing, such as body language; it's possible to express your deepest feelings very precisely without saying a word.

Another language you use each day is your mother tongue, which you use to manifest your will and to ponder reality. Computers have their own language, too, called machine language, which is very rudimentary.

A computer, even the most technically sophisticated, is devoid of even a trace of intelligence
